    "Create a python program for taking user notes in text file. When a user starts it up, it should prompt them for a filename.\n",
    "If they enter a file name that doesn't exist, it should prompt them to enter the text they want to write to the file.\n",
    "After they enter the text, it should save the file and exit.If they enter a file name that already exists, \n",
    "it should ask the user if they want:\n",
    "A) Read the file\n",
    "B) Append the file\n",
    "C) Delete the file and start over\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user wants to read the file it should simply show the contents of the file on the screen.\n",
    "If the user wants to start over then the file should be deleted and another empty one made in its place.\n",
    "If a user elects to append the file, then they should be able to enter more text, \n",
